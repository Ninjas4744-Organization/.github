<p>In 2011, our team was established and named: NINJAS #4744. Today, the group consists of about 20 students from grades 9 to 12, who deal with the team's challenges: The creation and branding of the group, the recruitment of new students, the raising of resources (such as tools, budget, materials, etc.), sketching and programming the robot. Dealing with all these challenges while keeping the spirit of FIRST, on the annual strategy decided and on the schedule of the group. The vision of our group is to raise interest and curiosity among the youth of Hadera to engage in the field of science and technology, which will help them acquire knowledge and experience that will be used throughout their lives.</p>
